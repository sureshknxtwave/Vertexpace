  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
Verify Setup
Confirm that all dependencies are installed and no errors occur during setup.

2. Running the Project:
Development Mode

To run the project in development mode, use:
npm start
This will start the development server, and the app will be accessible at:
http://localhost:3000

Building for Production
To create a production build, use:

npm run build
The optimized build files will be available in the build/ directory.

Testing Responsiveness
After running the development server, test the app's responsiveness by resizing the browser window or using device emulation tools in the browser's developer tools.

3. Design Notes
Figma Design Reference:
The layout and styles are based on the Figma design available at:
Figma Link

Pixel-Perfect Implementation:
The design closely follows the Figma layout with accurate spacing, font sizes, and alignments.

Global Styles:
Tailwind CSS is used to maintain consistent typography, colors, and spacing throughout the application.

Accessibility:
Semantic HTML and ARIA roles are implemented to ensure inclusivity.

4. Functionality Notes
Reusable Components
The project uses modular and reusable components to reduce redundancy.
Components are stored in the src/components directory for easy management.
Responsive Design
Fully responsive layouts are achieved using Tailwind's utility-first CSS approach.
Breakpoints like sm, md, lg, and xl are used to handle different screen sizes.
Dynamic Elements
Hover effects, animations, and interactivity have been implemented based on the Figma design.
State Management (Optional)
If dynamic functionality is required, React's useState or a global state management tool like Redux Toolkit can be used.
